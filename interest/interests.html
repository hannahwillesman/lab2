<h1>My Interests!</h1>
<h2>Crypto</h2>
<p> I have a massive interest within cryptography, bitcoin, ciphers and just the art of encryption, hiding data
and more or less how to keep things secure.  On the other side, breaking stuff! Cracking encryptions is one of 
my favourite passtimes, I will take any opportunity to get hands on!</p>

<h2>Vegan</h2>
<p> I have been vegan for the past 3 years (before it was cool).  I feel strongly against using animals for our
food, clothes etc.  Therefore, I will not participate with these acts and stand up for anaimal rights!</p>
